# Dragon-RPG

This was my individual final project for AP Computer Science, Spring 2020. This dungeon crawler is complete with pathfinding enemies, a combat system, player inventory, multiple levels, item progression, and a final boss fight. The game has a cohesive retro look brought together by music and sound effects produced by me.
